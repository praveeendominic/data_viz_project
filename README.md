## Steps to run the visualizations:
STEP 1:
Goto the below furnished url:
https://share.streamlit.io/praveeendominic/data_viz_project/main/app.py

 STEP 2:
You are now in the homepage of the application. The web application hosted has 3 pages to be navigated. Navigation is enabled using a dropdown menu. The homepage provides a description of high-level overview of the project design.

STEP 3:
Choose the option “Descriptive analytics”.

STEP 4:
You are now in the web page that contain visualizations that portray the decline in the US air travel. The visualizations are broadly grouped using 3 different dashboards and 1 story to represent a summary inference.

STEP 5:
Try interacting with dashboard titled: ‘Airline travel in America:2020 vs 2019’. This dashboard compares the air travel in US before and after the impact of covid.

a)	Clicking one of the lines of the ‘Total passengers:Jan-Oct’ line chart changes the corresponding data in the other visualizations in the dashboard. Green line represents 2019 data and purple line represents 2020 data.
b)	Similarly, when the bars represented in the charts ‘Monthly passengers 2020 vs 2019’, ‘Top 10 carriers’ and ‘Top 10 routes’ are clicked the corresponding data gets selected in the accompanying visualizations.
c)	Except the ‘Airline wise impact’ line chart, all other charts have the filtering ability i.e. when elements on the chart is selected, the corresponding data gets selected in the accompanying charts in the dashboard.

STEP 6:
Try interacting with dashboard titled: ‘ROUTE WISE IMPACT ANALYSIS. This dashboard shows the major city/route wise impact. 
a)	The ‘Popular routes’ chart shows a visual representation of the flight travelling from one of the most popular US cities, Atlanta. This is static and represents the route and the number of passengers travelled during the pandemic.
b)	Click the ‘Top 10 routes’ bubble chart and view the accompanying changes in ‘Visualize route’, ‘Passenger travel ratio’ and ‘Month wise impact details’ for the route selected.
c)	Note that the ‘Top 10 routes’ bubble chart is the only chart that has the filtering capability. The accompanying visualizations in the dashboard provide useful insights through Tool tips and by their representation. 
d)	‘Visualize route’ provides a visual representation of the route selected.

STEP 7:
Try interacting with dashboard titled: ‘STATE & CITY WISE IMPACT ANALYSIS’. This dashboard shows the major city/route wise impact. 
a)	Click a state in the ‘State map’ to view accompanying changes in the state wise month-on-month change in the number of passengers travelling and the accompanying moving average in the state selected.
b)	For the state selected, the city-wise impact is shown using the tree chart.
c)	The associated routes for the state selected is displayed dynamically in the ‘Visualize route’ viz.

STEP 8:
In the summary inference section, navigate through the tabs provided to view dashboard wise insights.

STEP 9:
By now, you have covered all the visualizations represented in the ‘Descriptive analytics’ menu. Now choose the menu option ‘Diagnostic & Predictive analytics’ 

 STEP 10:
  Click the play buttons highlighted below one after another. This plays a short animation that show the correlation in time between the rise of the covid and the decline in the US flight travel.
 


STEP 11:
In the regression dashboard, choose the years using the dropdown list box and click on the play button highlighted to see a short animation to see the line chart trend of the number of passengers travelling.
 

You also have the option to choose the year and state to see how the trend lines fit to the data in study.

STEP 12:
Similarly, explore the options provided in the ‘Clustering & forecasting’ dashboard.

STEP 13:
In the summary inference section, navigate through the tabs provided to view dashboard wise insights.
